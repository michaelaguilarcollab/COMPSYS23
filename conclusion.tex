\section{Conclusions and Future Work}


In conclusion, we are developing a solution to enable HPC ecosystems to move from statically defined infrastructure to dynamically defined infrastructure where workload resources can be provisioned depending upon workload needs to provide the correct resources to right applications at the right times.

In this paper, we described the OFMF architecture which enables composing platforms through management of network fabrics, storage fabrics, memory fabrics, and provisioning of GPUs, and CPU components with the goal of enabling interoperability through common interfaces to enable client Managers to efficiently connect workloads with resources in a complex heterogenous ecosystem without having to worry about the underlying network technology.  We illustrated the architecture of a composability layer, Redfish RESTful API, the OFMF layer, and the design of a sample Agent.
